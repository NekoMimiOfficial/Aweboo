# history  
I wanted to create an open source anilist client which is web based bcuz it'd look nice on desktop, plus with plugin support i can add legal ways to stream your "legally" aquired anime files  
some work got done, and a very simple interface emerged  
it also was developed in termux+nvchad on my smasnug J6 with a crappy 2$ keyboard  
much more crazy stuff happened and now this project is dead...
